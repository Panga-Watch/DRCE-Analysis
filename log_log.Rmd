######## Random Hypotheses ########

## years_fishing adds more predictive power and has a lower p value than age -- use years_fishing 
## hypothesis: the longer someone has been fishing the more value they put into having this technology.

## income/gdp_prop: hypothesis: a higher income will place a higher value on the technology... model disagrees.. could have an interesting dialogue 

## education: a more educated person will likely want to pay more for this technology.. they will see more benefit in it. However, possible that we have some collinearity with education and income... should we debunk this? 

## fishing_org_members: hypothesis: a larger fishing organization size will place less value on tracking tech because they feel safer while fishing... more people around to help if something goes wrong. They also probably share more information with eachother anyways? <---- don't include this. Not all of our respondents were in a fishing organizatio..

## Test if education and income are correlated. 
ggplot(bind_log_final, aes(x = income_usd, y = wtp, color = education)) + geom_point() ## it seems that education vs income are pretty random... ok to both use in the model.

How to interpret our coefficients:
The coefficient on a dummy variable with a log-transformed Y variable is interpreted as the percentage change in Y associated with having the dummy variable characteristic relative to the omitted category, with all other included X variables held fixed.

Justification for using a log-log model:
For interpretation. In economics, we are sometimes interested how a percentage change in x affects the percentage change in y. This called elasticity. We can estimate elasticity (f) by using a log-log model

By controlling for female in the original equation, we are estimating the relationship between hours worked and weekly salary having adjusted for systematic differences in hours worked and weekly salary between females and males. (A bit wordy, yes, but this is my preferred interpretation.)

Fixed effects (in the context of this page) are just a fancy extension of the idea of controlling for a categorical variable.

As a presentation note, people often do not present the actual fixed effects estimates in their results. They often just note that fixed effects were included, but don’t present the actual numbers because they are not typically interpreted.
